# üöÄ Nest Microservices Chat!

This project provides a powerful and scalable foundation for building a modern chat application using NestJS microservices. By leveraging the microservices architecture, it ensures seamless communication between different components, scalability, and modularity for future enhancements.

The chat system is built using NestJS's microservices capabilities, allowing each service to handle a specific aspect of the application, such as user management, messaging, and real time socket notifications. These services communicate with each other using efficient and secure protocols like TCP or gRPC, ensuring low-latency and reliable performance, even in high-demand scenarios.

### üîç Key features include:

- üß© **Microservice Architecture:** A modular structure with four independent microservices: `auth`, `conversations`, `participants`, and `messages`. These services communicate via TCP or gRPC, ensuring scalability and separation of concerns.
- üóÑÔ∏è **Database Integration:** MySQL is used as the primary database, with TypeORM configured for seamless interaction and migration management to handle schema changes across services.
- üîê **Authentication and Authorization:** A dedicated `auth` microservice implementing JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions, including registration, login, and user management APIs.
- üí¨ **Real-time Communication:** Socket.IO integration for real-time messaging and updates, enabling seamless communication between clients and the backend.
- üìÑ **API Documentation:** Auto-generated API documentation using NestJS DTOs for a consistent and clear API structure.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Validation and Error Handling:** Utilizes `class-validator` for easy validation through decorators, along with custom exceptions and tailored messages to ensure robust error handling.
- üê≥ **Docker Support:** Each microservice has its own Dockerfile, and a `docker-compose.yml` file in the main directory allows you to run all microservices together, ensuring consistent deployment across environments.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

- **`apps/` :**

  - This folder contains individual NestJS microservices that handle different aspects of the chat application. Each microservice is responsible for a specific feature or functionality within the system.

    - Each microservice has its own configuration file (`.env`) to manage environment-specific settings.
    - A dedicated `Dockerfile` for containerizing each microservice, enabling independent deployment and scalability.
    - A separate `package.json` for managing dependencies, scripts, and specific configurations for each microservice, ensuring isolation and modularity within the project.

  - The current microservices in the `apps/` folder are:

    - **`auth/` :** Manages user authentication and authorization, including registration, login, and JWT token generation for secure user sessions. In addition to the user module and authentication functionality, it also includes a **socket** folder for implementing real-time communication. This module enables WebSocket connections for real-time chat events, allowing the application to emit events to connected clients.
